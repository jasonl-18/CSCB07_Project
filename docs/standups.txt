What have you done since yesterday?
          	- Familiarize myself with Android Studio.
          	- Start working on a sample version of my assigned user story (trying to make a working RecyclerView)
What are you planning on doing today?
          	- Try and finish my sample user story, fixing the issues I have with it.
Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
          	- Lack of time with classes and tons of assignments.
          	- Sample RecyclerView is not responding at the moment, I need to figure out the issue with it.

What have you done since yesterday?
          	- Finished my sample user story, so that it is ready to be copied and tweaked once the login is uploaded.
          	- Fixed issue that I had yesterday (I assumed the database as all strings when the Players field was a number).
What are you planning on doing today?
          	- Make tweaks to the UI possibly.
Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
          	- Lack of time with classes and tons of assignments.
